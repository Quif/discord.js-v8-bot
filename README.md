# discord.js-v8-bot
This was my personal bot for discord.js v.8 i am making this open source and going to make a discord.js v.9 bot.

# installation
Before you can run this, you need to install a few things,
``npm install npm install discord.js@8.1.0``
This installs discord.js
``npm install tinyurl``
This installs tinyurl (I have a url shortener command.)
###cd desktop
###git clone https://github.com/Quif/discord.js-v8-bot MyBot -b master 
###cd    

To run go in command prompt and type 
``node /Users/samjouhari/Desktop/MyBot.js`` for mac and 
``node "C:\Users\Username\desktop\MyBot.js"`` for windows.

# Command list (coming soon.)

# Thats all really, have fun with the bot!
